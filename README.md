## Aim:

To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation

## Algorithm:

1.  Begin by researching and exploring the capabilities of leading AI video generation platforms. Key tools include:
      - Runway Gen-2 – text-to-video model known for photorealistic output.
      - Synthesia – avatar-based AI video generation for presentations and narrations.
      - Pictory – converts scripts or blogs into short videos.
      - DeepBrain – generates AI avatar videos from text and templates.
2.  Understand the unique features, limitations, and output styles of each model before experimentation.
3.  Start with simple, general prompts to observe how the model interprets broad instructions.
      - Example Prompt: “Dog playing in a park.”
4.  This allows you to observe default behaviors like motion, background rendering, and pacing.
5.  Progressively add richer descriptions including objects, weather, background, and actions.
      - Example Prompt: “A golden retriever joyfully chasing a bright red ball across a lush green park on a sunny afternoon.”
6.  This helps analyze how well the model captures spatial relationships, object interactions, and environmental features.
7.  Enhance prompts by adding camera movement, timing, or transition effects.
      - Example Prompt: “A slow-motion video of a golden retriever leaping to catch a red ball thrown by an unseen person. The camera follows the dog's movement.”
8.  This step tests how well the model handles scene transitions and visual dynamics over time.
9.  Use prompts to generate videos in various artistic styles or genres.
      - Example Prompt: “A heartwarming video of a happy golden retriever wagging its tail excitedly while its owner throws a ball in a vibrant park filled with colorful flowers.”
10. This reveals the model’s stylistic capabilities and creative range.
11. Review the generated video and revise your prompt for better precision. Focus on aspects like:
      - Camera angles
      - Transitions and pacing
      - Environmental effects
      - Character movements
12. Refined Prompt Example: “A low-angle shot of a playful golden retriever running towards the camera with a tennis ball in its mouth, its ears flapping in the wind in a sunny park.”
13. Each revision allows better control over the output and improves model alignment with intended visual storytelling.
14. Generate several videos from the same base prompt with small wording changes to see how phrasing impacts results.
      - Compare output based on adjectives (“joyfully chasing” vs. “energetically running”)
      - Change action verbs (“chasing” vs. “fetching”)
      - Adjust motion descriptors (“slow-motion” vs. “dynamic”)
